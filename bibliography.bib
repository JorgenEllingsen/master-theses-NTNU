abstract="We present an identity management scheme built into the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing for identities that are as indelible as the blockchain itself. Moreover, we take advantage of Bitcoin's decentralized nature to facilitate a shared control between users and identity providers, allowing users to directly manage their own identities, fluidly coordinating identities from different providers, even as identity providers can revoke identities and impose controls.",

abstract="Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols have been actively researched for the past five years. PoS finds direct applicability in open blockchain platforms and has been seen as a strong candidate to replace the largely inefficient Proof of Work mechanism that is currently plugged in most existing open blockchains. Although a number of PoS variants have been proposed, these protocols suffer from a number of security shortcomings; for instance, most existing PoS variants suffer from the nothing at stake and the long range attacks which considerably degrade security in the blockchain.",

abstract="Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses a ledger (or ``blockchain'') to keep track of the transactions made between its users. Because it is a fully decentralized system and anyone can join, every transaction is by necessity public. Thus, to preserve some semblance of privacy, users in the system are represented not by their real-world identities but by pseudonyms. While pseudonyms are acceptable for a standalone cryptocurrency, the emergence of other potential blockchain-based applications --- e.g., using them to administer benefits and pensions --- poses a need to associate certain attributes with the users of the system. In this paper, we address the question of how to register identities and attributes in a system built on globally visible ledgers. We propose a variety of possible solutions and in each case, we analyze the tradeoff our solution provides between privacy (ensuring that no one can associate the user's real-world identity with the pseudonym or other attributes they use on the ledger), usability (ensuring that verification of their attributes poses the lowest possible burden to users), and integrity (ensuring that no one can impersonate a user). We also present an implementation of one of our solution using Ethereum.",
