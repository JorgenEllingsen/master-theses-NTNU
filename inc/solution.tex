The DLREP function is a collection of functions proposed by \cite{Brands2000}, and used by \cite{Augot2017}. The instance generator outputs a tuple \[(q, g_1, g_2,...,g_l)\]

\section{Sovrin Protocol and Token}
The Sovrin Foundation have set out on a mission to standardize and create an infrastructure for Self-Sovereign identities, using blockchain as storage for Distributed Identities such that anyone can issue or verify it~\cite{sovrin}. The Sovrin blockchain has been designed only for identity, and is taking steps to move the digital trust away from centralized CAs to a web of trust model. The Soverin SSI model is not dependent on any particular distributed ledger, but can work with any blockchain that meets the fundamental principles. Sovrin has implemented their identity system in a specific instantiation of Hyperledger's Indy project
